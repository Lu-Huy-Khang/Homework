            Plot
            After living a painful life as an office worker on Earth, Azusa ends up dying from overworking. She finds herself reincarnated as an undying, unaging witch in a new world, and now she vows to spend her days as pleasantly and stress-free as possible. She makes a living by hunting slimes, the easiest targets. But after centuries of doing this simple job, she has become extremely powerful and finds that she can no longer maintain her low-key lifestyle.
            
            Characters
            Azusa Aizawa (アズサ・アイザワ / 相沢梓, Azusa Aizawa / Aizawa Azusa)
            Voiced by: Aoi Yūki (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Skyler Davenport[5] (English)
            A former Japanese office worker reincarnated as an immortal witch, called "the Witch of the Highlands" (高原の魔女, Kōgen no Majo). Weary of any overwork and excitement following her untimely death in her old life, she strives for an easy tune of existence, but once word gets out of her unprecedented prowess, she finds herself beleaguered by challengers trying to prove themselves on her, or all sorts of people willing to join her. However, she is compassionate and in time becomes very protective of her adopted family, much to the chagrin of anyone who deliberately endangers them.
            Laika (ライカ, Raika)
            Voiced by: Kaede Hondo (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Rachelle Heger[5] (English)
            A roughly 300-year-old shape-shifting red dragon girl. Originally arrogant, she came to Azusa to fight her and prove herself to be stronger than her. After getting soundly beaten by Azusa, she joins her as her first apprentice and housekeeper, eventually becoming her adoptive younger sister. She has a rivalry with Flatorte.
            Falfa (ファルファ, Farufa)
            Voiced by: Sayaka Senbongi (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Lizzie Freeman[5] (English)
            An about 50-year-old slime spirit girl, and the elder of twin sisters. She is one of Azusa's adoptive daughters. Both she and her sister Shalsha are reincarnations of the slime creatures that Azusa killed for a living; but while Shalsha is initially deeply resentful towards Azusa at first, Falfa adores her and considers her their "mother".
            Shalsha (シャルシャ, Sharusha)
            Voiced by: Minami Tanaka (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Suzie Yeung[5] (English)
            Falfa's younger slime spirit twin sister. She is one of Azusa's adoptive daughters. Driven by feelings of revenge against Azusa for killing all the slimes, she learned a type of magic which is effective against one specific race only, but in turn is potent enough to counter even Azusa's magic; she is also very learned in magic lore. After being very easily beaten by Laika, Shalsha and Falfa join Azusa's household upon her invitation. In turn, she abandoned her desire for revenge upon learning that she is not the only one targeting slimes. She is very inquisitive, and habitually takes notes of anything new she comes across.
            Halkara (ハルカラ, Harukara)
            Voiced by: Sayaka Harada (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Xanthe Huynh[5] (English)
            A young (about 225-year-old) female elf apothecary woman from Frant Province with very abrupt mood swings and a voluptuous build. She invented an extremely popular, alcohol-based energy drink; but when the demon lord Beelzebub drank from it, she became sick (from overworking after getting addicted to it) and then went after Halkara, whereupon the elf, believing that Beelzebub wanted in fact revenge, fled to Azusa for protection. After being given shelter, and after the misunderstanding with Beelzebub is cleared, Halkara decides to stay with Azusa and restart the production of her energy drink. She is very knowledgable about mushrooms, but scatterbrained and accident-prone.
            Beelzebub (ベルゼブブ, Beruzebubu)
            Voiced by: Manami Numakura (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Erica Mendez[6] (English)
            An about 3,000-year-old high-ranking female demon, the Agriculture Minister of the Demon Realm, and Lord of the Flies. Chasing after Halkara after getting addicted to her energy drink (so that its production could be re-started) she challenges Azusa to a fight, but collapses from exhaustion and is nursed back to health by her and Halkara. After the misunderstanding was cleared, she leaves peacefully, but vows to come back to settle her score with Azusa (which she ultimately loses) and get more of Halkara's drink, although she begins to settle in as one of Azusa's "family", eventually becoming Azusa's adoptive older sister.
            Flatorte (フラットルテ, Furattorute)
            Voiced by: Azumi Waki (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Amber Lee Connors[7] (English)
            An over 400-year-old blue dragon girl who first meets Azusa and her extended family while she and her flock attempt to disrupt the wedding of Laika's older sister, out of simple jealousy that her blunt demeanor drove away her own fiance. After Azusa single-handedly thrashes the aggressors, and a final act of aggression is stalled by Beelzebub, she is forced to sign a peace treaty between the red and blue dragons. Afterwards, as part of her peace obligations, she also (much to Laika's disgust, which results in them becoming rivals) joins Azusa's troupe—the only alternative being to commit suicide due to her culture.
            Rosalie (ロザリー, Rozarī)
            Voiced by: Riho Sugiyama (drama CD, anime)[4] (Japanese); Anne Yatco[8] (English)
            A ghost girl who died about 200 years previously at the age of 15. The daughter of a merchant who had fallen on hard times, she committed suicide after learning that her father wanted to sell her off as a prostitute. Her restless ghost began haunting the merchant's estate, which later became the site for Halkara's new energy drink factory. After being caught by Azusa, Halkara and Beelzebub, she is, with some effort, relocated to Azusa's house and joins her adopted family.
            Fatla (ファートラ, Fātora)
            Voiced by: Miku Itō (anime)[9] (Japanese); Veronica Taylor[10] (English)
            A leviathan woman, Beelzebub's secretary, and Vania's older sister. She and Vania are both shapeshifters, able to assume the form of a gigantic, flying whale. Despite the myth that leviathans are water creatures, they are actually air dwellers, and are usually employed as living transportation (complete with a resort hotel on their backs) by demons, devils and their privileged guests. To fulfill this obligation, both sisters work in tandem: While one does the transport, the other uses the hotel facilities (especially the bath) to relax.

            An over 1,000-year-old demon girl and the "King" of the Demon Realm from its capital city Vanzeld. Despite her awe-inspiring title, her natural form is a cute, petite girl with ram horns and three tails, and she is, most of the time, surprisingly cheerful and informal. She has also a submission complex; after being accidentally knocked out by Halkara, and with Azusa beating her in a duel over Halkara's life, she gladly submits to her "conqueror".
            Smart Slime (賢いスライム, Kashikoi Suraimu, lit. 'Wise slime')

            In anime: Magie / Magician Slime (マースラ / 魔法使いスライム, Māsura / Mahō Tsukai Suraimu)
            Voiced by: Miyuri Shimabukuro (anime)[9]

            Wizly (in light novel and manga) / Magie (in anime) is name given to her by Azusa.

            Voiced by: Ayasa Itō (anime)[9] (Japanese); Veronica Taylor[13] (English)
            An about 300-year-old fighter slime girl whom Azusa and the others seek out when Falfa is stuck in slime form after getting a crick in her neck. She is very materialistic and considers fighting a means to collect more and more prizes. After being easily beaten by Azusa, she considers joining her as a martial arts apprentice, but instead becomes Beelzebub's apprentice after learning about the slimes that Azusa killed.
            Fighsly (in light novel and manga) / Fightie (in anime) is name which she herself decided to use, and was not given to her by Azusa.

            An over 150-year-old immortal witch, called "the Witch of the Grotto" (洞窟の魔女, Dōkutsu no Majo). Naive and deadly shy, but yearning for recognition, she usurps the title of "Highland Witch" to capitalize on Azusa's reputation and make herself some new friends. When Azusa hears of the fake, she confronts Eno and afterwards helps her in selling her mandragora-based medicines, which prove extremely popular. Her title stems from the location of her workshop, which is situated inside a hard-to-reach underground location, thus contributing to her initial lack of renown.
            Pondeli (ポンデリ, Ponderi)
            An undead catgirl who died 40 years ago after she became so lazy from boredom that she forgot to even feed herself. After rising from death, she became a graveyard security guard, but felt lonely without anyone keeping her company. Azusa solves the problem by suggesting to Beelzebub that Pondeli is made a demon casino gambler, since the catgirl is wickedly good at playing cards.

            Natalie

            Locations
            Flatta village
            This is the story's main setting. Azusa lives close to this village.
            Mount Rokko
            This volcano is the homeland of the red dragons. This is where Laika came from.
            Demon Realm
            A city where demons reside. This place is controlled by Pecora.
            World Tree
            A giant tree that has been hollowed out and turned into a tourist attraction. It has 108 floors, each containing different challenges.
            Aizawa Azusa has overworked herself to death at twenty-seven years old. A sympathetic Goddess reincarnates her as an immortal witch in a new world. Azusa is determined to live a peaceful life, building a farm in the mountains and hunting slimes every day to pass the time. Three hundred years has passed, and she becomes known as the Witch of the Highlands by the people of Flatta village due to her medicinal knowledge. On a whim, she has the adventurer’s guild measure her powers and finds the experience of killing multiple slimes every day for 300 years is equal to defeating 4380 dragons. She is now the strongest adventurer in the entire world. Soon, her carefree life is repeatedly interrupted by challengers, including Laika, a legendary dragon, who challenges her and is defeated, though she accidentally destroys Azusa’s house. Laika returns in the form of a young girl, hands over her treasure hoard to repair Azusa’s home, and asks to become Azusa’s pupil. Hoping it may make her life easier in the long run, Azusa accepts Laika as her pupil/maid, deciding to show her a little daily effort can go a long way, starting with building them a bigger house to live in.
            The very ordinary company OL (Office Lady), Azusa Aizawa, died from overwork.

            For that reason, I decided to live a slow life in a house in the mountains as an immortal witch with the figure of a 17 year old.
            
            The main source of income is to defeat slimes inhabiting the area to acquire magic stones. I sold these at the Guild in the village. Besides that, I made medicinal herbs, became known as “The Witch of the Highlands”, and lived with respect and trust.
            
            However, as a result of continuing to beat slimes for 300 years, the experience values accumulated too much, and I unknowingly became level 99, the world’s strongest witch.
            
            The level 99 witch now works together in the village with her dragon-girl apprentice in moderation, while helping everyone in the village.
